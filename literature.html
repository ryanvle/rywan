          <h2>Wild Geese</h2>
          <a href="https://www.orcity.org/DocumentCenter/View/1367/March-2019-Poetry-Post---Wild-Geese-by-Mary-Oliver-PDF">by Mary Oliver</a>
          <blockquote>"Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
            the world offers itself to your imagination,
            calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
            over and over announcing your place
            in the family of things."</blockquote>

          <h2>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</h2>
          <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">by Laurel Schwulst, for The Creative Independant and Are.na</a>
          <blockquote>"Instead of a cloud, let’s use a metaphor that makes the web’s individual, cooperative nodes more visible. This way, we can remember the responsibility we each have in building a better web. The web is a flock of birds or a sea of punctuation marks, each tending or forgetting about their web garden or puddle home with a river of knowledge nearby."</blockquote>
        
          <h2>Life is Short</h2>
          <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">by Paul Graham</a>
          <blockquote>"When I ask myself what I’ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is “bullshit.” I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It’s almost the definition of bullshit that it’s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience."</blockquote>

            <h2>how to avoid half-heartedness</h2>
            <a href="https://www.avabear.xyz/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness">by Ava</a>
            <blockquote>"My answer is that if you tolerate too much half-heartedness, it’s probably because <i>you’re</i> half-hearted."</blockquote>

            <h2>The Marriage Lesson That I Learned Too Late</h2>
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220413143253/https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/marriage-problems-fight-dishes/629526/">by Matthew Fray</a>
            <blockquote>"If I had to distill the problems in failed relationships down to one idea, it would be our colossal failure to make the invisible visible, our failure to invest time and effort into developing awareness of what we otherwise might not notice in the busyness of daily life."</blockquote>

            <h2>Becoming a Magician</h2>
            <a href="https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/">by Anonymous</a>
            <blockquote>"Not only is any sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic; any sufficiently advanced technologist seems like a magician. In order to write the new version of this life description, I need to imagine a version of myself who, by definition, I cannot understand. If I understood her she wouldn’t be magical."</blockquote>

            <h2>Every site needs a Links Page / Why linking matters</h2>
            <a href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/thoughts/every-site-needs-a-links-page-why-linking-matters">by Melonking</a>
            <blockquote>"Links are the lifeblood of the web, and linking to other sites is a declaration of independence. Its a declaration that says, “I am the infrastructure of the web, I am not content, nor am I a product, I am a human and a participant in this great work of humanity we call the Internet”."</blockquote>
